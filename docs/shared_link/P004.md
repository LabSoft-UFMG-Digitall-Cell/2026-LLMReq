alternative flow and main flow

ChatGPT said:

Sure\! Let's go:

🔁 Main Flow (or Success Path)

It is the ideal path the system follows when everything happens as expected, without errors. It describes the normal steps of a use case execution.

📌 **Example – Use Case: "Log In."**

1. The user accesses the login screen.  
2. The system requests the username and password.  
3. The user fills in and submits the data.  
4. The system verifies if the data is valid.  
5. The system redirects the user to the main screen.

🔀 Alternative Flow (or Exception Flow)

These are variations of the main flow. They handle different situations, such as errors, decisions, or secondary paths that may occur during the process.

📌 Example – Alternative Flow for "Log In"

A1 – Invalid data:

3a. The user fills in incorrect data.

4a. The system detects an error and displays a message: "Invalid username or password."

5a. The system returns to the login screen.

A2 – Blocked account:

4b. The system identifies that the account is blocked.

5b. Displays the message: "Your account is blocked. Contact support."

✍️ **Documentation Tip:**

* The main flow goes in the main body of the use case.  
* Each alternative flow can be numbered and described separately (A1, A2...).

If you'd like, I can help you write this for a specific use case of your system\! Want to do that?

GreenMarket – Organic Products Shopping App: Consumers can buy fruits, vegetables, and other organic products directly from small-scale producers. The app allows users to track the origin of products and offers a subscription system for weekly deliveries. Additionally, consumers can interact with producers through an integrated chat to ask questions about cultivation, certifications, and the best ways to store food.

Possible features: order history

Sure\! Here is a filled-out example for GreenMarket – order history feature, based on your template:

✅ DESCRIPTION

AS A: GreenMarket app consumer

I WANT TO: view my order history

SO THAT: I can track previous purchases, repeat orders, and manage my spending.

💡 USE CASE: View Order History

🔁 Main Flow (Success Path)

GIVEN THAT: the consumer is logged into the app

AND: has previous registered orders

WHEN: they access the "Order History" section

THEN: the system displays a list with all orders made, including date, total value, products purchased, and delivery status.

🔀 Alternative Flow 1 – No previous orders found

GIVEN THAT: the consumer is logged into the app

AND: has never placed an order

WHEN: they access the "Order History" section

THEN: the system displays a message: "You haven't placed any orders yet. How about checking out our products?"

🔀 Alternative Flow 2 – Server connection failure

GIVEN THAT: the consumer is logged in

AND: has previous orders

WHEN: they access the "Order History" section

THEN: the system displays the message: "Error loading history. Please check your connection and try again."

If you want, I can set up this same format for other features, such as the chat with producers, weekly delivery subscription, or tracking product origin. Should I continue?
