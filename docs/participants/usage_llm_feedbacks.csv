code,positive,negative
P001,"Speed and efficiency, clear and standardized structure, ease of iteration and adaptation.","Lack of deep domain context, answers may be generic or superficial, over-reliance on an external tool."
P002,Speed and greater ease in developing ideas when completing the task.,"Less learning, as the person relies on using the LLM and ends up thinking less about the activity."
P003,Time-saving for repetitive tasks. Inspiration for activities requiring creativity.,Dependence on LLMs. Generic answers.
P004,"Greater ease in solving problems, saving time, and having broader thinking.","You do not exert enough effort to solve problems, which may limit you in other projects without using it."
P005,Agility in creating descriptions and use cases. Support in organizing ideas based on the template. Clarity in explanations and suggestions based on the provided context. Ease in reviewing and adjusting texts with instant feedback.,"May generate dependence, reducing autonomous writing practice. If the question is poorly formulated, the result may be unexpected. The model does not always understand specific teacher constraints."
P006,Speed and accuracy.,Lack of authenticity.
P007,Speed in generating standardized descriptions for multiple stories and use cases.,"Not always correct, so the time to review the story and use case becomes longer."
P008,Speed.,Generic answers.
P009,Ease in interpreting and finding contexts and examples for answers.,Sticking to an idea that is not your own can make it difficult to follow a reasoning line.
P010,Greater speed and convenience.,There is a chance the AI interprets requests incorrectly and delivers wrong answers.
P011,"The main positive points of completing the task Yes are practicality, speed, and assistance.",The main negative points of completing the task Yes are automated answers and limited reasoning capacity.
P012,"Practicality, different perspectives, detailed explanations.","Generalized answers and consequently, generalized use cases."
P013,"Practicality and speed in creating model topics, delivering use cases you might have overlooked.","Tendency not to read what was delivered, need to correct context."
P014,"You can clarify many doubts that may arise during an activity. For example, in the first questionnaire, I didn’t remember what a main flow and alternative flow were. This speeds up problem-solving and makes work much more productive.","Often we take the LLM’s answer as true without reading or seeking other sources, which can lead to using incorrect or overly generic information."
P015,Speed and dynamism.,Lack of personalized thinking.
P016,"Ease of understanding what is being said, and it already generates something that makes it easier to just modify what I think is wrong. Additionally, I can ask questions if I have doubts, and it is fast when performing Yesle.","The negative point is that you don’t need to exert as much effort to think about the task, which may prevent consolidating knowledge on a specific subject."
P017,"Helps improve ideas, streamline processes, and acquire new knowledge quickly.",Decreased creativity and worse learning depending on usage.
P018,"Using LLMs for tasks like creating user stories offers various benefits, such as faster content generation, standardization following defined templates, and creative suggestions for both main and alternative flows. It also reduces common errors and rework, facilitating communication between technical and non-technical teams. The LLM allows customization of the level of detail according to the audience and ensures clear, complete, and consistent documentation, optimizing requirement definition in agile projects.","Although using LLMs brings many benefits, there are some negative points to consider. The main limitation is that the model may generate content that seems correct but contains inaccuracies or does not fully reflect the project context, always requiring human validation. There may also be overgeneralization or lack of sensitivity to specific business rules if not clearly provided. Continuous use without critical reflection can reduce active team participation in requirement building, impacting alignment and understanding of the final product."
P019,"Ease, time-saving, and convenience.",Not bothering to check what was generated.
P020,"Speed in content production, ease in following predefined structures like templates, and help in generating ideas in a clear and cohesive way. Additionally, the LLM can provide creative and well-founded suggestions, accelerating writing or planning processes.","The possibility of generating generic answers or responses that do not fully fit the user’s specific context. There is also a risk of dependence on the model for tasks that could be done autonomously, along with the need to review the generated content for accuracy and purpose alignment."
P021,"It is fast in generating responses and produces them accurately. If not as expected, small corrections can be made.","Reduces opportunities for critical thinking and independent development, negatively affecting long-term task development."
P022,The speed at which tasks can be completed.,Generic answers.
P023,1. Speed in solving the problem. 2. Identification of new use cases previously not considered.,1. The result may be far from the expected scenario. 2. You end up depending on the tool since you already receive the material ready.
P024,Faster and more practical.,Answers are not always correct.
P025,Ease in obtaining ideas for possible scenarios and use case contexts according to the story; correction and evaluation of the user’s response.,Lack of attention from the developer to notice details in the generated or used scenario.
P026,Completing tasks is much faster and helps generate insights.,"Artificial intelligence, especially ChatGPT, often hallucinates. So, if the user lacks critical capacity and prior knowledge on the subject, there is a high chance of receiving an incorrect answer and submitting it as is."
P027,Speeds up the work.,Lack of requirement correction and validation.
P028,Higher speed with better quality depending on the question.,Lower adherence of the content to the student using the LLM.
