P018,"Although the use of LLMs brings many benefits, there are also some negative aspects to consider. The main limitation is that the model may generate content that seems correct but contains inaccuracies or does not fully reflect the project context, requiring constant human validation. In addition, there may be excessive generalization or a lack of sensitivity to specific business rules if they are not clearly provided. Another issue is that continuous use without critical reflection may reduce the team’s active participation in requirements construction, which can affect alignment and understanding of the final product.",Inaccurate,Reliability
