 Please do it using both templates, and in the second one create a main flow and an alternative flow.

**ChatGPT said:**  
 Sure\! Just confirm one quick thing: are you referring to the two use case templates? Like:

* Essential Template (simpler)

* Expanded/Complete Template (with main and alternative flows)?

If so, also tell me the name of the use case you want me to use as an example (e.g., “User Login,” “Register Student,” “Purchase Product,” etc.). I can base everything on something from your gym system if you want.

 GreenMarket – Organic Products Shopping App: Consumers can buy fruits, vegetables, and other organic products directly from small producers. The app allows tracking the origin of products and offers a subscription system for weekly deliveries. In addition, consumers can interact with producers through an integrated chat, asking questions about cultivation, certifications, and best storage practices.  
 Possible features: Producer geolocation, order history, recurring subscription, product reviews.

**TEMPLATE:**  
 **DESCRIPTION**  
 **AS A:** \<Persona\>  
 **I WANT:** \<Goal\>  
 **SO THAT:** \<Reason\>

**USE CASES (Main or Alternative Flow)**  
 **GIVEN THAT:** \<precondition\>  
 **AND … AND …** \<preconditions\>  
 **WHEN:** \<action\>  
 **THEN:** \<postcondition(s)\>

**ChatGPT said:**  
 Perfect\! I’ll show you two completed templates based on your GreenMarket app.

✅ **1\. ESSENTIAL TEMPLATE (simpler):**  
 **DESCRIPTION**  
 Weekly subscription system for delivering organic products to consumers.

**AS A:** Health-conscious consumer who values healthy and sustainable products  
 **I WANT:** To subscribe to a recurring delivery of organic fruits and vegetables  
 **SO THAT:** I can receive fresh products weekly without having to place new orders every time

✅ **2\. EXPANDED TEMPLATE (with flows):**  
 **USE CASE:** Subscribe to Weekly Deliveries

**GIVEN THAT:**  
 The consumer is logged into the app  
 AND has completed registration with a valid address and payment method  
 AND there is a subscription plan available in the region

**WHEN:**  
 The consumer selects the desired subscription plan and confirms the purchase

**THEN:**  
 The system registers the subscription, schedules weekly deliveries, sends a confirmation email, and adds the plan to the consumer’s profile

✅ **Main Flow:**  
 The consumer accesses the “Subscription” section in the app  
 Views the available plans for their region  
 Selects a plan and clicks “Subscribe”  
 Confirms payment and delivery details  
 The system validates the information  
 The subscription is activated and the consumer is notified

🔁 **Alternative Flow (Plan unavailable in the region):**  
 The consumer accesses the “Subscription” section  
 Views the available plans  
 The system detects there is no coverage for the informed region  
 A message is displayed: “We do not deliver to your region yet. Leave your email to be notified when we become available.”  
 The consumer can choose to be notified in the future

If you want, I can create more use cases in this format: product reviews, producer geolocation, chat with producers, etc. Want another one?

**Participant said:**  
 Add a title to the essential template.

**ChatGPT said:**  
 Sure\! Here is the Essential Template with the title added:

✅ **ESSENTIAL TEMPLATE**  
 **Title:** Weekly Organic Products Subscription

**DESCRIPTION**  
 Weekly subscription system for delivering organic products to consumers.

**AS A:** Health-conscious consumer who values healthy and sustainable products  
 **I WANT:** To subscribe to a recurring delivery of organic fruits and vegetables  
 **SO THAT:** I can receive fresh products weekly without having to place new orders every time

If you want, I can create this same model for another feature, such as chat with producers or product reviews. Just ask\!

**Participant said:**  
 Deliver the flows following the template model.

**ChatGPT said:**  
 Perfect, [MASK_NAME]\! Here are the flows (main and alternative) strictly following the template model you provided:

✅ **USE CASE:** Subscribe to Weekly Deliveries

**Main Flow**  
 **GIVEN THAT:** The consumer is logged into the app  
 AND has an address and payment method registered  
 AND there are subscription plans available in their region

**WHEN:** They select a subscription plan and confirm the purchase

**THEN:** The system activates the subscription, schedules weekly deliveries, and sends a confirmation email

🔁 **Alternative Flow (Region without coverage)**  
 **GIVEN THAT:** The consumer is logged into the app  
 AND has an address and payment method registered  
 AND there are no subscription plans available in their region

**WHEN:** They attempt to select a subscription plan

**THEN:** The system displays the message “We do not deliver to your region yet” and offers the option to receive email notifications in the future
