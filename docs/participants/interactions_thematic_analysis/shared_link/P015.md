alternative flow and main flow

ChatGPT said:  
Sure\! Here it is:

🔁 **Main Flow (or success flow)**  
It is the ideal path that the system follows when everything goes as expected, without errors. It describes the normal steps of executing a use case.

📌 **Example – Use Case: "Login"**

1. The user accesses the login screen.  
2. The system requests the username and password.  
3. The user fills in and submits the data.  
4. The system verifies if the data is valid.  
5. The system redirects the user to the main screen.

🔀 **Alternative Flow (or exception flow)**  
These are variations of the main flow. They handle different situations, such as errors, decisions, or secondary paths that may occur during the process.

📌 **Example – Alternative Flow for "Login"**  
**A1 – Invalid Data:**  
3a. The user enters incorrect data.  
4a. The system detects the error and displays a message: "Invalid username or password."  
5a. The system returns to the login screen.

**A2 – Blocked Account:**  
4b. The system identifies that the account is blocked.  
5b. Displays the message: "Your account is blocked. Contact support."

✍️ **Documentation Tip:**  
The main flow goes in the main body of the use case.  
Each alternative flow can be numbered and described separately (A1, A2...).
