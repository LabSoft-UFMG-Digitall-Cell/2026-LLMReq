Based on the task image "Task 02 \- GreenMarket" and the provided template, here is a suggestion for a title, user story description, and two use cases (main and alternative flows):

**User Story Title:**  
Subscribe to Weekly Organic Product Delivery

**User Story Description (template):**  
AS a GreenMarket app consumer  
I WANT to subscribe to a weekly delivery plan of organic products  
SO THAT I can receive fresh food directly from local producers conveniently and regularly

**USE CASE – Main Flow**  
GIVEN the consumer is logged into the app  
AND accesses the subscriptions section  
WHEN they select a weekly delivery plan and confirm the payment method  
THEN the system activates the subscription and displays the expected date of the next delivery

**USE CASE – Alternative Flow**  
GIVEN the consumer is logged into the app  
AND accesses the subscriptions section  
WHEN they try to confirm the subscription, but the payment is declined  
THEN the system displays an error message and requests another payment method

If you want, I can generate more examples focusing on other functionalities, like chatting with producers or geolocation. Do you want me to do that?
