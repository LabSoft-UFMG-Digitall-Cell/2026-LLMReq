**Title:** Reporting Technical Issue and Collaborative Resolution

**DESCRIPTION**  
AS: TechFix platform user  
I WANT TO: report a technical issue and receive a quick and effective solution  
SO THAT: I minimize the impact of the problem on my work and learn from the solution provided

**USE CASE – Main Flow**  
GIVEN: The user identifies a technical problem on their device  
AND … accesses the TechFix platform and selects the "Report Issue" option  
AND … fills in the problem details, including category, description, and evidence (images or logs)  
WHEN: The user submits the report  
THEN: The ticket is registered, experts are notified, and the user can follow the interactions to the solution

**USE CASE – Alternative Flow**  
GIVEN: The user reports a technical problem but forgets to include essential information for diagnosis  
AND … the system detects missing information and requests the user to provide it  
WHEN: The user adds the missing details  
THEN: The ticket is re-evaluated, correctly registered, and experts are notified to start the analysis

Would you like me to also create a flow diagram representing these interactions? This can help a lot with visualization\!
