According to the attached template, create the necessary information following Software Engineering principles and answer the following questions:

1. What is the Title and DESCRIPTION of the user story? Use the TEMPLATE.  
2. What is the USE CASE for the main flow of the user story? Use the TEMPLATE.  
3. What is the USE CASE for the first alternative flow of the user story? Use the TEMPLATE.

See an example below:

TechFix – Collaborative Technical Support Platform: A startup launches a system where users can report technical problems, and experts can suggest solutions. The system allows users to vote on the best answers, and experts earn points based on how well their solutions are rated.

Possible features: Ticket registration, expert ranking, scoring system, notifications

**TEMPLATE:**  
DESCRIPTION  
AS:  
I WANT TO:  
SO THAT:

USE CASES (Main or Alternative Flow)  
GIVEN:  
AND … AND …  
WHEN:  
THEN: \<postcondition(s)\>

To create the requested responses according to Software Engineering principles and based on the file content (about using natural language models, such as LLMs, to support Requirements Engineering activities), here is a structured example:

1. **TITLE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE USER STORY**  
   Title: Assisted Requirements Generation with LLMs

DESCRIPTION  
AS: Requirements Analyst  
I WANT TO: use a natural language model to assist in generating and reviewing requirements  
SO THAT: I increase productivity and reduce inconsistencies in requirements documents

2. **USE CASE – Main Flow**  
   USE CASE: Requirements Generation with LLM

GIVEN: the requirements analyst is authenticated in the system  
AND … the system has access to a trained language model  
AND … the project already has a basic scope defined  
WHEN: the analyst requests automatic generation of requirements based on high-level descriptions  
THEN: the system generates a set of suggested functional and non-functional requirements for validation

3. **USE CASE – Alternative Flow 1**  
   USE CASE: Ambiguity Correction

GIVEN: the requirements analyst is authenticated in the system  
AND … the language model has identified ambiguities in existing requirements  
WHEN: the analyst requests reformulation suggestions for the ambiguous requirements  
THEN: the system presents clearer alternative versions of the requirements for the analyst to choose or edit

If you want, I can generate variations with other roles (such as developer or client) or with other alternative flows. Do you want that?

You said:  
Create one more alternative response, please

ChatGPT said:  
Sure\! Here is another alternative response, following the same template and still based on the proposed scenario of using LLMs in Requirements Engineering:

1. **TITLE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE USER STORY**  
   Title: Requirements Validation with AI Support

DESCRIPTION  
AS: Software Engineering Professor  
I WANT TO: use a language model to validate requirements created by students  
SO THAT: I ensure that requirements are clear, complete, and well-structured for educational purposes

2. **USE CASE – Main Flow**  
   USE CASE: Automatic Requirements Validation

GIVEN: the professor has access to a set of requirements created by students  
AND … the system is integrated with a language model capable of textual analysis  
AND … the requirements have been properly submitted to the platform  
WHEN: the professor triggers the automatic validation function  
THEN: the system analyzes the requirements and returns improvement suggestions, ambiguity alerts, and gaps

3. **USE CASE – Alternative Flow 1**  
   USE CASE: Incomplete Submission by Students

GIVEN: the professor has started validation of the requirements  
AND … the system detects that the requirements are incomplete or do not meet expected standards  
WHEN: the validation process is executed  
THEN: the system notifies the professor and students about the missing points and recommends corrective actions before proceeding with validation

If you want, I can also create a case focused on the student role using AI to learn or review requirements. Do you want that perspective as well?

Change everything, I want a response specifically for TechFix, according to the template below:

For the following context, use the attached template to create a DESCRIPTION of a user story of your choice with 2 USE CASES, one main flow and one alternative flow.

TechFix – Collaborative Technical Support Platform: A startup launches a system where users can report technical problems, and experts can suggest solutions. The system allows users to vote on the best answers, and experts earn points based on how well their solutions are rated.

Possible features: Ticket registration, expert ranking, scoring system, notifications

**TEMPLATE:**  
DESCRIPTION  
AS:  
I WANT TO:  
SO THAT:

USE CASES (Main or Alternative Flow)  
GIVEN:  
AND … AND …  
WHEN:  
THEN: \<postcondition(s)\>

ChatGPT said:  
Sure\! Here is a new response, specifically for the TechFix platform context, using exactly the requested template:

DESCRIPTION  
AS: User experiencing technical issues on their computer  
I WANT TO: submit a support ticket with details of my problem  
SO THAT: I receive prompt and appropriate help from experts on the platform

**USE CASE – Main Flow**  
GIVEN: I am logged into the TechFix platform  
AND I have filled out the required fields in the ticket form  
AND I selected the appropriate category for the problem  
WHEN: I click the “Submit Ticket” button  
THEN: the ticket is posted on the platform  
AND experts are notified of the new request  
AND the ticket is visible in my account for tracking

**USE CASE – Alternative Flow**  
GIVEN: I am logged into the TechFix platform  
AND I attempted to submit a ticket without completing all required fields  
WHEN: I click the “Submit Ticket” button  
THEN: the system displays an error message  
AND highlights the fields that need correction before submission is allowed

If you want, I can also create more stories for other roles, such as the expert or a platform moderator. Do you want that?

You said:  
I need a title for this user story

ChatGPT said:  
Sure\! A good title for this user story could be:

Title: Submission of Technical Support Ticket by Regular User  
This title clearly summarizes the main action (submitting a ticket) and the persona role (regular user). If you want something more informal or direct, I can suggest other options as well. Do you want me to?
