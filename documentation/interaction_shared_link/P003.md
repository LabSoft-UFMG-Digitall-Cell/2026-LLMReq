 For the following context, use the attached template to create a **DESCRIPTION** of a User Story of your choice with **2 USE CASES**, one being a **main flow** and the other an **alternative flow**.

GreenMarket – Organic Products Shopping App: Consumers can buy fruits, vegetables, and other organic products directly from small producers. The app allows users to track the origin of products and offers a subscription system for weekly deliveries. In addition, consumers can interact with producers through an integrated chat, asking questions about cultivation, certifications, and best storage practices.

Possible features: Producer geolocation, order history, recurring subscription, product reviews.

 Sure\! Here is an example filled in based on the GreenMarket context:

**DESCRIPTION**  
 **AS A:** Consumer of the GreenMarket application  
 **I WANT:** To subscribe to a weekly delivery of organic products  
 **SO THAT:** I can automatically receive a selection of fresh, certified products at home without having to place a new order every week

**USE CASES**

**Main Flow – Weekly Delivery Subscription**  
 **GIVEN THAT:** I am logged into the application  
 **AND:** I have a delivery address registered  
 **AND:** My payment method is active and valid  
 **WHEN:** I select the “Weekly Subscription” option and choose the products or the type of box I want to receive  
 **THEN:** The system confirms the subscription  
 **AND:** Displays the date of the next delivery  
 **AND:** Starts scheduling automatic weekly deliveries with recurring billing

**Alternative Flow – Subscription Failure Due to Invalid Card**  
 **GIVEN THAT:** I am logged into the application  
 **AND:** I have a delivery address registered  
 **AND:** My payment method is expired or invalid  
 **WHEN:** I try to complete the weekly subscription  
 **THEN:** The system displays an error message indicating a payment problem  
 **AND:** Requests that I update my payment details to complete the subscription

If you want, I can create more user stories with other features such as producer chat or geolocation—just let me know\!

 What title would you give to the user story?

**Model said:**  
 A good title for this user story would be:

**“Weekly Organic Products Subscription”**

This title is clear, accurately represents the main goal of the story, and makes it easy to quickly identify the functionality in a backlog or task board. If you’d like something more detailed or in a different style (e.g., more technical or more user-experience-oriented), I can suggest alternatives as well.
