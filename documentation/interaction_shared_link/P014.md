Based on the provided image, here are the most complete and complex possible answers for each requested question, using the presented templates:

1. Title and DESCRIPTION of the user story  
   **Title:** Geolocation and Interaction with Organic Producers

**DESCRIPTION:**

AS A: Conscious consumer engaged in healthy eating  
I WANT TO: locate nearby organic producers and interact with them through the app  
SO THAT: I can ensure the origin of the food, clarify cultivation doubts, and make more informed choices

2. USE CASE of a normal flow of the user story  
   **USE CASE (Main Flow):**

GIVEN: the user is logged into the app and has granted access to their location  
AND ... AND ... there are registered producers near the user’s location  
WHEN: the user accesses the app’s interactive map  
THEN: the system displays the nearest organic producers, with details about their products, ratings, and a chat button for direct contact

3. USE CASE of the alternative flow of the user story  
   **USE CASE (Alternative Flow):**

GIVEN: the user is logged into the app  
AND ... AND ... there are no registered producers near the provided location  
WHEN: the user attempts to access the producers’ map  
THEN: the system displays a message informing that no producers are available in the area, offers the option to expand the search radius, and suggests that the user enable notifications to be alerted when new producers are registered in the area

4. Observation  
   The complexity and differentiator of this user story lie in the combination of real-time geolocation and direct communication channel with the producer, promoting transparency, trust, and engagement. Additionally, this flow encourages more sustainable and conscious purchasing decisions, strengthening the local producers’ network.

What is the difference between normal flow and alternative flow?

ChatGPT said:  
Great question\! The difference between normal flow and alternative flow lies in expected behavior vs. exceptions or variations in system use. Here is a clear and concise explanation:

✅ **Normal Flow (or Main Flow):**  
It is the ideal path, describing how the functionality should work when everything goes correctly.

The system and the user follow the planned steps without errors or deviations.

It is the most common scenario, foreseen for the feature’s operation.

**Example in the GreenMarket app:**

The user accesses the map → The system finds nearby producers → Shows the results → The user interacts with the producer.

⚠️ **Alternative Flow:**  
It is the path that describes variations or exceptions to the normal flow.

It may occur when a condition is not met, when there is an error, or when the user takes a different path.

The system must handle this appropriately, offering other options.

**Example in the GreenMarket app:**

The user accesses the map → The system does not find nearby producers → Shows a “no producers found” message → Suggests increasing the search radius.

🧠 Quick Summary:

| Flow Type | What it is? | When it occurs? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Normal Flow | Ideal path | Everything happens as planned |
| Alternative Flow | Deviation from main flow | When there are exceptions, errors, or alternative choices |
