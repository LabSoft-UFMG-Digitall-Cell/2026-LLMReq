Sure\! Here is a suggestion for filling out your Task 02 – GreenMarket, based on the requested template:

**DESCRIPTION**  
**AS A:** Consumer interested in organic products  
**I WANT TO:** Subscribe to a weekly delivery plan for fruits and vegetables  
**SO THAT:** I can receive fresh products at home regularly and support local small producers

**USE CASE (Main Flow)**  
**GIVEN THAT:** the user is logged into the application  
**AND:** has a registered address  
**AND:** there are subscription plans available for their region  
**WHEN:** the user accesses the “Weekly Subscriptions” tab and selects a plan  
**THEN:** the plan is activated upon payment confirmation  
**AND:** the user starts receiving products weekly at the selected address

**USE CASE (Alternative Flow)**  
**GIVEN THAT:** the user is logged into the application  
**AND:** has a registered address  
**AND:** there are no subscription plans available for their region  
**WHEN:** the user attempts to subscribe to a weekly plan  
**THEN:** the system displays a message informing that there are no deliveries available in the region  
**AND:** offers the option to be notified when availability becomes available

If you want, I can adapt this to another use case, such as product reviews or chat with the producer. Just let me know\!

Here is an example of how you can fill out this questionnaire clearly and objectively, based on the activity we carried out together:

What is your name and email?  
\[MASK\_NAME\] – \[MASK\_EMAIL\]

In your opinion, what are the main positive points of performing the task using an LLM?

* Speed in preparing descriptions and use cases.  
* Support in organizing ideas based on the template.  
* Clarity in explanations and suggestions based on the provided context.  
* Ease of reviewing and adjusting texts with instant feedback.

In your opinion, what are the main negative points of performing the task using an LLM?

* It may create dependency, reducing autonomous writing practice.  
* If the question is poorly formulated, the result may not meet expectations.  
* The model does not always understand specific instructor constraints.

In your opinion, what are the main positive points of performing the task without using an LLM?

* Encourages critical thinking and technical writing practice.  
* Develops autonomy in structuring user stories and use cases.  
* Helps better consolidate requirements engineering concepts.

In your opinion, what are the main negative points of performing the task without using an LLM?

* It may take more time, especially when there are doubts about structure or language.  
* Difficulty reviewing what was produced without quick second-opinion feedback.  
* Risk of getting stuck during creation without support from practical examples.

Give a positive example of a question and answer from the LLM.  
**Question:**  
“Can you help me write a user story with two use cases (main flow and alternative) about the GreenMarket application?”  
**LLM Answer:**  
\[Provided a well-structured and clear description of the user story, with two use cases organized according to the template.\]

Give a negative example of a question and answer from the LLM.  
**Question:**  
“Make something there for GreenMarket.”  
**LLM Answer:**  
\[Generated a vague answer with a generic user story, without focus on the requirements or structure required by the exercise.\]  
(The issue here was the lack of clarity in the question.)

How can the use of an LLM influence the learning process?  
The LLM can accelerate learning when used as a support tool, helping to structure ideas and clarify doubts. However, its use must be conscious so that it does not replace individual reflection and the development of personal skills.

Use this space for a general comment.  
I found the activity very productive, especially because of the opportunity to see how to apply requirements elicitation concepts in practice. The use of the LLM helped a lot to visualize the correct structure and quickly correct parts of the text.

Share the link to the conversation with the LLM.  
(You can copy the conversation link by clicking on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the screen and choosing “Share conversation” \> “Copy link”.)  
If you want, I can also generate a summary of the conversation based on the content we covered here.

If you want me to generate a shareable conversation link, just let me know\!
